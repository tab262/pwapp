pwapp
=====

Run python pwapp.pw to launch program

Depending on version of python 'Tkinter' is sometimes written 'tkinter'...

Needs plenty more work, but seems to be in working condition (time to try and break it). Need to add some key and pw confirmation entries to avoid 
thinking we've saved the proper key and password only to find it retrievable later. This will probably entail moving some
objects around. Tkinter object placements were quick and dirty for the time being, all of them using the place method
instead of pack.
